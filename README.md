ColourObject
============

This is your typical colour type converter thingy except its sort of an object.  
At the time of making this I heard of Getters and Setters and um, got carried away.  
I know most people love callback chainging but it kinda bugs me so I wanted to see  
what the code that uses this would look like.  
I also wanted something that could parse css but handle errors better than some of  
the stuff I had seen.  Most give you white/black if theres any errors where as I  
wanted something that would know what is right and use it.  It also remembers the  
originating type and gives back as close as possible to that.  Plus I planed on  
using this in a text editor and wanted lazy selecting, so it does that too.  
  
This was also meant for a colour picker that I still havent finished, its also a little  
different in that it only uses the canvas and no css as I wanted something I could  
convert into other languages.  Now Ive bumped into this again I might finish that  
soon.
